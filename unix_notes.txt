Git & Unix Workshop Notes:

unix :
-multi process multi user
-data as plaintext files (easy to read)
-nested subdirectories (folders) (easy to organize)
-many small programs (text editor, music player, web browser, operating system)
-input-output redirection (input - someplace other than keyboard. output- go to some place other than screen) (history to screen, history to file)
-kernel manages hardware
  —>      other programs
                     ^kernel^(traffic control)
             ^cpu^memory^devies
                                                safe from hackers. password protected.
unix shell (provides user interface to kernel)(command line>graphical>multi-touch>audible)(when hearing shell, typically think command line) (shell protects user from directly accessing kernel)
kernel sweats the the low level cpu stuff

     terminal:
     -app that runs the shell
      package manager(app store of free stuff for command line)
     -chsh=change shell

      sublime text:
      -text editor

     path:
     -represents location in filesystem
     -like an address—>general to specific.
     -absolute when starts with a slash
     -relative when i does not start with a slash
      cd = change directory (absolute or relative)
      pwd=shows directory (ex:/Users/Reeve)
     cd / = brings you to root. the topmost container in filesystem
     root = restricted to admin users. don’t delete from root.
     ls = list contents in directory
     blue colored= directory
    pink colored = link
    red colored = program
    white colored = file
    ls -t = (modification time) sort by modification date
    ls -l = (long form). more info for list. alphabetical
    ls -r = “r” reverses the order
    man = manual (ex. man ls shows manual for ls)
    la = will show everything
    ll - shows  list long human readable
    \ = part of last string
   ! unix power users tend not to use spaces. use “-“ and “_”. CASE SENSITIVE. (ex:
   Apple.txt and APPLE.txt and not the same file) (OS X is case  insensitive, those files
   would be the same) (unix, command line case sensitive)
   --IN UNIX (terminal) WRITE ALL FILE NAMES LOWERCASE, NO SPACES.--
   -change relative directory ex: “cd Desktop”
   -change absolute directory ex: “cd /Desktop”
   -“..” to go up a level
   -“.” displays current directory
   -history - shows all history
   -history | less - organizes single file
    -less - organizes large body of texts into readable single file
| - “pipes” to another program
> - move file name from left side to right side. (can create a file name)(if name already exists it will be overwritten)
>> - to append or create
cat - shows all content of file
mv = move file to directory +rename them +move&rename
mkdir = make directory
repository  = a place to store history of file
“.” before a file or directory means it is hidden
-touch = to modify time without modifying content. also creates file.
